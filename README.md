# Number Puzzle Generator

You know those puzzles that present you with some numbers, and then ask you
what the next number in the sequence should be? Like 1, 2, 3, ...
Well, this little tool can create a variety of such puzzle sequences, with
different rules of complexity.


# About the code
To be clear, I am not an experienced Python Programmer.
It's written in Python because I happened to be maintaining some Python code
at the time. So some of this may look sane, other bits may look atrocious :)


# Feedback

In any case, as long as you find it useful, that's good.
Improvements (pull requests!) welcome.
Also ports to other languages, such as Go.
Enjoy!
